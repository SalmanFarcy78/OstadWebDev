            ingredients for chicken biryani
Here's everything that you'll need to make biryani: <br>

Chicken: I only like to use thighs and drumsticks for chicken biryani because they remain juicy and don't overcook through the long cooking time. For me, chicken breast is a big no no as it will dry out and will just be rubbery.
Yogurt: Greek yogurt, plain yogurt or homemade curd/dahi works well. Acts as a tenderiser and add some tanginess to the masala
<br><br>
<b>Fried Onions: </b> Also called birista, I've outlined the process to make fried onions at home below. But these days, packages fried onions are easily available and are more convenient option. To store a large amount of fried onions, place them in an airtight container and freeze them for later
Tomato Puree: Used in the marinade for flavour and body
<br><br>
<b>Ginger Garlic Paste:</b> Simply ground ginger and garlic, I recommend making this at home, but if you are in a hurry, store bought works too
<br><br>
<b>Whole Spices:</b> Bay leaf, Cloves, Green Cardamom and Saffron (kesar for that distinct orange colour) - these form the flavour base and give biryani that distinct fragrance that wafts up as soon as you open the pot
Ground Spices: Red Chilli Powder (sub with a mix of paprika and cayenne if living outside India), turmeric powder and garam masala powder
<br><br>
<b>Herbs:</b> Fresh mint and coriander leaves (cilantro) are essential to making biryani. They add freshness and bring the rice and chicken together
<br><br>
<b>Fat & Dairy:</b>

Both oil and ghee. You can choose to only use ghee but in my opinion, it makes the biryani even richer. But ghee is what was traditionally used to make biryani. You'll also need a little milk to soak the saffron strands
<br><br>
<b>Basmati Rice: </b>
This is a key ingredient in most biryani recipes, even the ones outside India like the Pakistani biryani and Afghani biryani. Please note that basmati rice is different from long grain rice. Basmati has long grains but also comes with a distinct fragrance and flavour. Look for aged basmati rice that has been aged for at least 1-2 years.

Fried onions and basmati rice</h2> 
<img src="BasmotiOnionFry.jpg" width="600"> <br>
Fried onions are a key ingredient here, and it’s important to get this right. Onions are cut into slices and then browned on medium flame in oil. They don't need to be extra crispy, but onions should be a deep golden brown without getting burnt. You can also use store bought fried onions which are easily available in supermarkets these days. 
<br><br>
While choosing rice for the biryani, make sure to buy 'basmati rice' and not long grain rice. While they may look similar at first, good quality basmati rice is fragrant, and has grains that are thin and long as opposed to long grain rice which has fatter grains and almost no fragrance. 
<br><br> The basmati rice is cooked for exactly 5 minutes in boiling water with whole spices and salt to get it to the right doneness - which is 70%. Drain the rice well to get rid of any excess water. The rice will continue to steam when we finally cook it along with the chicken and that's where it picks all the flavour and perfume from the chicken, saffron, mint leaves and coriander.

<h3>How to marinate chicken for biryani</h3>
This Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani gets a lot of its flavor from the marinade. We are using yogurt as a tenderiser, fried onions (birista), tomato puree, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala and salt to flavor the chicken. It's important to marinate the chicken in a large bowl for at least two hours or overnight for the maximum flavor. Like I said before, I prefer using only chicken thighs and legs for chicken biryani because these are the juiciest and do not become dry while the biryani cooks.
